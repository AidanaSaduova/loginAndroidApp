# loginAndroidApp

This project is a prototype for my Bachelor thesis, which includes only a simple login function.  

Current project includes Swagger library, which were generated from Swagger spec and used to test API-first development feature. Swagger spec is the same for Android client and Backend (micro service).

The only aim of this project is to test API endpoints of the Login micro service, which you can find here: https://github.com/AidanaSaduova/loginApi
